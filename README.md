# QHGeoGPT: A Domain-Specific Language Model for Intelligent Geological Reasoning in the Qin-Hang Metallogenic Belt

**QHGeoGPT** is a domain-adapted language model developed to address semantic, causal, and terminological challenges in geoscientific question answering. It is designed specifically for applications in the Qin-Hang metallogenic belt, integrating geological ontology, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and curated domain corpora.

> 📢 *Note: Due to intellectual property and academic integrity concerns, the model implementation and weights are not publicly released. However, we provide open access to the training corpus samples and evaluation datasets to support academic benchmarking and reproducibility.*
